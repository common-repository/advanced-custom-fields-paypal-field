== Description ==

The PayPal Item Field is a simple, yet useful field that can help you integrate PayPal forms onto your WP site with the use of ACF. It's a faster way of adding single PayPal items to any post or page on your site without having to login to your PayPal Account and creating it yourself. Using the native ACF function the_field(), you can display a simple form that includes the item Name, item Description, price, and you can enable/disable user quantity input.

The PayPal Item Field currently supports 343 countries and 18 different currencies.
